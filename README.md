# Video game currency converter

This is a small web app to convert fake currencies from video games universes to another.

It was done in pair programming to teach some of the basics of doing web development (at least the frontend side) while designing a small app in the process.

## Status

This project is a work in progress, and will be for a while since we work on it small bites at a time ;)
